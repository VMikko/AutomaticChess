Code for an automatic physical chess board using Arduino.

Used AccelStepper library for the stepper motors

NOTE: We did not get strong enough of an electromagnet, which meant that we couldn't implement the use of the magnet in the way that we wanted (could not 'choose' the pieces that we wanted to move) -- But the implementation of it would be an easy 5 min change to the code
